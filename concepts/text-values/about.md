# About Unison text values

Textual values or "strings" are represented by the `Text` type in Unison. `Text` values are Unicode characters which are created with the double quote syntax.

```
textValue : Text
textValue = "Hi there!"
```

The Unison standard library, `base` contains many useful functions for manipulating `Text` values under the namespace `base.Text`.

You can also translate between a `Text` value and its representation as a `Char` (individual character) list with the `toCharList` and `fromCharList` functions. This means you can also make use of the functions on both the `List` and the `Char` type when you're working with `Text` values.

`Char` values are single character values represented with a question mark: `?a`

A list of `[?a,?b,?c]` can be translated into the `Text` value `"abc"` and vice-versa.

## Common operations on text values

Text concatenation uses the `++` operator to join text values together.

```
myValue = "abra " ++ "cadabra"

> myValue
  ⧩
  "abra cadabra"
```

If you need to quote a special character (like double quotes or single quotes) or represent control characters like newline or tab, you can use the backslash `\` character as a character escape.

```
jsonValue = "{\"key\":42}"
```

A full list of valid escape characters can be found in [the official language docs][escape-chars].

Should you need to join a list of text values with a character delimiter, check out `Text.join` function.

```
myCsv = Text.join "," ["apple", "pear", "banana"]

> myCsv
  ⧩
  "apple,pear,banana"
```

And finally, if you need to split a `Text` value on a character, use the `Text.split` function

```
myList = Text.split ?, "apple,pear,banana"

> myList
  ⧩
  ["apple", "pear", "banana"]
```
